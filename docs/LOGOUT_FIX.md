## Date: 2025-10-10

### Issue
Logout button was not functioning properly when clicked.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Logout Function

**File**: `lib/auth-context.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
const logout = async () => {
  await signOut()
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
const logout = async () => {
  try {
    console.log('Starting logout process...')
    
    // Sign out from Firebase first
    await signOut(auth)
    
    // Clear all state
    setUser(null)
    setFarmerProfile(null)
    setBuyerProfile(null)
    
    console.log('Logout successful')
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Logout error:', error)
    // Clear state even if signOut fails
    setUser(null)
    setFarmerProfile(null)
    setBuyerProfile(null)
    throw error
  }
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- âœ… Added `auth` parameter to `signOut(auth)` (required by Firebase)
- âœ… Clear all user state after signout
- âœ… Added error handling
- âœ… Added console logs for debugging
- âœ… Clear state even if Firebase signout fails

---

### 2. Improved Dashboard Logout Handler

**Files**: 
- `components/dashboard-layout.tsx`
- `components/horizontal-dashboard-layout.tsx`

**Before**:
```typescript
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  await logout()
  router.push("/")
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
const handleSignOut = async () => {
  try {
    console.log('Signing out...')
    await logout()
    console.log('Logout complete, redirecting...')
    router.push("/")
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sign out error:', error)
    // Force redirect even if logout fails
    router.push("/")
  }
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- âœ… Added try-catch for error handling
- âœ… Added console logs for debugging
- âœ… Force redirect even if logout fails
- âœ… Better error reporting

## How to Test

### Test 1: Normal Logout

1. **Login to the app**:
   - Go to `http://localhost:3001`
   - Sign in as a buyer

2. **Navigate to dashboard**:
   - Should see buyer dashboard
   - Look at top-right corner

3. **Click profile icon**:
   - Green circle with user icon (ðŸ‘¤)
   - Dropdown menu should open

4. **Click "Sign out"**:
   - Should see console logs:
     ```
     Signing out...
     Starting logout process...
     Logout successful
     Logout complete, redirecting...
     ```
   - Should redirect to home page
   - Should be logged out

5. **Verify logout**:
   - Try to access `/buyer-dashboard`
   - Should redirect to login page
   - Confirms logout worked

---

### Test 2: Check Browser Console

Open browser console (F12) and watch for these logs when you logout:

```
Signing out...
Starting logout process...
Logout successful
Logout complete, redirecting...
```

If you see these logs, logout is working correctly!

---

### Test 3: Check Session Cleared

After logout:

1. **Check localStorage**:
   - Open browser DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Local Storage
   - Firebase auth tokens should be cleared

2. **Try protected routes**:
   - Navigate to `/buyer-dashboard`
   - Should redirect to login
   - Cannot access without signing in again

3. **Check user state**:
   - Open React DevTools
   - Check AuthContext
   - `user` should be `null`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still not logging out

**Check browser console for errors**:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Click "Sign out"
4. Look for error messages

**Common errors**:

**Error**: `signOut is not a function`
- **Solution**: Check Firebase import in `lib/auth-context.tsx`

**Error**: `auth is not defined`
- **Solution**: Verify `auth` is imported from `./firebase`

**Error**: Network error
- **Solution**: Check Firebase configuration

---

### Issue: Logout works but doesn't redirect

**Solution**:
1. Check if `router.push("/")` is being called
2. Look for console log: "Logout complete, redirecting..."
3. If log appears but no redirect, check Next.js router

---

### Issue: Can still access dashboard after logout

**Solution**:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Clear cookies
3. Close and reopen browser
4. Try logout again

## What Happens During Logout

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **User clicks "Sign out"**
   - `handleSignOut()` is called in dashboard layout

2. **Logout function executes**
   - `logout()` is called from auth context
   - Console log: "Starting logout process..."

3. **Firebase signout**
   - `signOut(auth)` is called
   - Firebase clears authentication tokens

4. **State cleared**
   - `setUser(null)`
   - `setFarmerProfile(null)`
   - `setBuyerProfile(null)`

5. **Success logged**
   - Console log: "Logout successful"

6. **Redirect**
   - `router.push("/")`
   - User sent to home page

7. **Complete**
   - User is logged out
   - Cannot access protected routes
